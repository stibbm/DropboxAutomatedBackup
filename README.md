# DropboxAutomatedBackup
Backs up your files to your Dropbox account and stores a local file that tracks which files have already been backed up and skips backing those up next time


## Connecting to your Dropbox account
Go to the Dropbox Developers Documentation : https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation
Then click the App Console button on the top right of that page (may need to log in first)

## Once at the App Console
* Create an App and provide either full access or single folder access either one will work.
* Generate an Access key to be able to upload to your dropbox account from -- Do not share this with anyone.
* In order for the App to use your access key for uploads, save it in a file named "Access.txt". Access.txt must be in the
folder that the program is running from.
